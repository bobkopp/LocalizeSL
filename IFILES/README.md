* **SLRProjections200204GRIDDEDcore_SROCC.mat**: Core file for gridded K14 projections used in Kopp et al. (2017), 13 January 2017, updated 28 June 2021 for consistency with IPCC SROCC Antarctic projections. (Copyright (C) 2021 Robert E. Kopp. Provided under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.)

* **SLRProjections200204GRIDDEDcore_D20.mat**: Core file for gridded K14 projections used in Kopp et al. (2017), 13 January 2017, updated 4 February 2020 using Antarctic projections of DeConto et al. (2021). (Copyright (C) 2020 Robert E. Kopp. Provided under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.)

* **SLRProjections200204GRIDDEDcore_SROCC.mat**: Core file for gridded K14 projections used in Kopp et al. (2017), 13 January 2017, updated 4 February 2020 for consistency with IPCC SROCC Antarctic projections. THIS VERSION IS DEPRECATED DUE TO AN ERROR IN RCP8.5 ANTARCTIC CONTRIBUTIONS.

* **SLRProjections190726core_SEJ_full.mat**: Core files for RCP8.5+H and 2.0degree+L scenarios in the structured expert judgement of Bamber et al. (2019), 24 July 2019. This version uses a cubic spline to interpolate between the elicited time periods, and updates the previous version (SLRProjections190301core_SEJ.mat), which provided only the elicited time periods. This file contains two corefile variables, one associated with the RCP8.5+H scenario and one with the 2.0degree+L scenario. Using these corefiles with processing routines requires some careful attention to the scenario specification passed to various functions, as each corefile contains only one scenario and the scenario labels differ from other corefiles. For post-2100 RCP8.5+H projections, note that some caution is required, as these combine RCP 8.5 for non-ice sheet components with a 5°C stabilization for ice sheets; the RCP8.5+H scenario may underestimate the ice-sheet contribution under RCP 8.5 (or, conversely, overestimate other components for 5°C stabilization.) This is less of a problem with the 2.0°C stabilization scenario (see Figure 1 of Rasmussen et al., 2018, for the associated temperature trajectories for the non-ice sheet components).

* **SLRProjections180124GRIDDEDcore_Tscens.mat**: Core file for 1.5°C, 2.0°C and 2.5°C scenarios derived from K14, as developed in Rasmussen et al. (2018), 24 January 2018. Using this corefile with processing routines requires some careful attention to the scenario specification passed to various functions, as the number of scenarios and scenario labels differ from other corefiles.
